# HelloComplexity

## Description

Imagine if a "Hello, World!" program had a wild night out and decided to take the scenic route home. 
This Python script is what you'd get the morning after: a convoluted, encryption-heavy, threading-laden way to say "Hello" that only makes sense if you squint at it sideways.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Cryptography library

## Setup

First, make sure Python is not just a snake in your backyard but also installed on your computer. 

If not, [Python's official site](https://www.python.org/) is your go-to.

Next, we'll need to invite the cryptography library to the Python party:

    pip install cryptography

## Usage

To get this party started:

    python main.py

Enter your name when prompted.

The script will then twist and turn through a maze of "why did I do this?" before finally greeting you.

## Contributions

Feel free to add your own flair of over-the-top complexity to this digital Rube Goldberg machine. 
Contributions should maintain the serious spirit of the project (i'm looking at you NASA).
